/* wheather Throwable and Exception are checked or unchecked?

- in case of methods Exception and Throwable both are acting as a checked.
  (with respect to throws both are acting as checked)


- but with respect to try catch both are acting as a unchecked
	
== thats why we call Exception and Throwable as semi-checked*/
